# C Sharp (C#)

> "Although C# is derived from the C programming language, it has features such
> as garbage collection that allow beginners to become proficient in C# more
> quickly than in C or C++. Similar to Java, it is object-oriented, comes with
> an extensive class library, and supports exception handling, multiple types of
> polymorphism, and separation of interfaces from implementations. Those
> features, combined with its powerful development tools, multi-platform
> support, and generics, make C# a good choice for many types of software
> development projects: rapid application development projects, projects
> implemented by individuals or large or small teams, Internet applications,
> and projects with strict reliability requirements." - C# Progamming Wiki books

## Why C Sharp

C# is a well established enterprise language suited for desktop applications,
web applications and game development.

## My Goals with C Sharp

In multiple benchmarks I have seen how .NET outperformed a lot of frameworks
which is why my interest in this language first grew. On the other hand, the
Unity game engine is a great opportunity to build cross-platform games and dive
into game development which was one of my first inspirations to start learning
to program.
